# Routing

## Defining routes

With Inertia all routing is defined server-side. Meaning you don't need Vue Router or React Router. Simply create routes using your server-side framework of choice.

## Generating URLs

Some server-side frameworks allow you to generate URLs from named routes. However, you will not have access to those helpers client-side. Here are a couple ways to still used named routes with Inertia.

The first option is to generate URLs server-side and include them as props. Notice in this example how we're passing the `edit_url` and `create_url` to the `Users/Index` component.

        class UsersController extends Controller
        {
            public function index()
            {
                return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
                    'users' => User::all()->map(function ($user) {
                        return [
                            'id' => $user->id,
                            'name' => $user->name,
                            'email' => $user->email,
                            'edit_url' => URL::route('users.edit', $user),
                        ];
                    }),
                    'create_url' => URL::route('users.create'),
                ]);
            }
        }
      `,
    },
    {
      framework: 'rails',
      name: 'Rails',
      language: 'ruby',
      code: dedent`
        class UsersController < ApplicationController
          def index
            render inertia: 'Users/Index', props: {
              users: User.all.map do |user|
                user.as_json(
                  only: [ :id, :name, :email ]
                ).merge(
                  edit_url: edit_user_path(user)
                )
              end,
              create_url: new_user_path
            }
          end
        end
      `,
    },
  ]}

Another option is to make your route definitions available client-side as JSON, and then use this to generate URLs from your named routes.

```php
<script>
  let routes = {{ json_encode($routes) }}
</script>
```

If you're using Laravel, the <a href="https://github.com/tightenco/ziggy">Ziggy</a> library does this for you automatically via a global `route()` function. If you're using Ziggy with Vue.js, it's helpful to make this function available as a custom `$route` property so you can use it directly in your templates.

```js
Vue.prototype.$route = (...args) => route(...args).url()
```

```html
<inertia-link :href="$route('users.create')">Create User</inertia-link>
```

For Ruby on Rails there is a similar library called <a href="https://github.com/railsware/js-routes">JsRoutes</a>.
